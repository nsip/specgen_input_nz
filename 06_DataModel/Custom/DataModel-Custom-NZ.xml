		<Intro>
			<p>The New Zealand customisation of the SIF AU data model,
			includes the following (high-level) changes:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>SchoolInfo data object is replaced with Provider
				data object, as the scope of SIF NZ data model is intended
				to encompass early childhood education, compulsory schooling (K-12)
				and tertiary education (higher education).
				</li>

				<li>StudentPersonal data object doesn't include Alert
				or MedicalAlert messages; Demographics area includes
				multiple NZ statistical standard Ethnicity and Iwi
				affiliations.</li>
				
				<li>StudentContactPersonal data object is a subset of PersonInfo data object,
				in that providers don't collect OtherNames, Demographics or Education &amp; Employment
				information about student's whƒÅnau members.</li>

				<li>ProviderRelationship data object records relationships between two education providers.</li>
				
				<li>StudentProviderEnrolment expands on StudentSchoolEnrollment, and has extra complexity
				to cope with SIF NZ having Providers, rather than Schools.</li>
			</ul>
