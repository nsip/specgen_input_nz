    <p>The SIF NZ data model was forked from the SIF AU data model,
    includes the following (high-level) changes:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>The <code>SchoolInfo</code> data object from SIF
        AU is replaced with <code>Organisation</code> data object,
        as the scope of SIF NZ data model is intended to
        encompass early childhood education, compulsory
        schooling (K-12) and tertiary education (higher
        education).</p>
        <p><code>Organisation</code> also describes education organisations (such as KƒÅhui
        Ako, and Learning Support Clusters) that are known to the NZ education system, not limited to
        Schools and other Providers.</p></li>

        <li><code>OrganisationRelationship</code> data object
        records relationships between two education organisatons</li>

        <li><p><code>StudentPersonal</code>, <code>StaffPersonal</code> and <code>StudentContactPersonal</code>
        data objects no longer share the same <code>PersonInfo</code> object, as each The Privacy Act
        means that the set of data we are permitted to store for each class of person is different.</p>
        <p>Demographics area includes NZ statistical standard Ethnicity and Iwi affiliations.</p></li>
        
        <li><code>StudentProviderEnrolment</code> expands on
        StudentSchoolEnrollment, and has extra complexity to
        cope with SIF NZ having Schools, ECEs and TertiaryOrganisations, rather than just Schools.</li>

        <li>Staff &amp; Student assignment and enrolment to <code>TeachingGroups</code> are 
        explicitly modelled with transactional data objects <code>StaffTeachingGroupAssignment</code> and
        <code>StudentTeachingGroupEnrolment</code>.  Merely including staff &amp; students in the TeachingGroup
        object is insufficient for Privacy Act requirements, we need to know exactly when staff and students were
        connected via their membership of TeachingGroup.</li>
    </ul>
